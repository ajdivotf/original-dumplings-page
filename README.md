# original-dumplings-page

this is the implementation of the task from the freecodecamp course - responsive web design. 

the results are:

this page view is designed to be viewed on a mobile device

<img src='https://github.com/ajdivotf/original-dumplings-page/blob/main/results/lil%20top.png' width='300'/><img src='https://github.com/ajdivotf/original-dumplings-page/blob/main/results/lil%20bottom.png' width='300'/>

this kind of page is designed to be viewed on a computer

<img src='https://github.com/ajdivotf/original-dumplings-page/blob/main/results/big%20top.png' width='600'/><img src='https://github.com/ajdivotf/original-dumplings-page/blob/main/results/big%20bottom.png' width='600'/>

there is also a video in the center of the page, but it is not displayed in the results because it looks the same in both view modes.
